      Growing up in a house with a forest behind my house was all that was
      needed to instill in me a love for outdoors. This green space gave me a
      place where I was able to create cool little forts! The interest of
      surviving in the wild was born! The location of my home was on the front
      range of Denver, Colorado so our family regularly took trips to the snow
      capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains. Sliding down those mountains created
      a zen pplace for me, thus I was now infatuated with snowboarding. When all
      activities were said and done, now was time to venture into rest. However,
      being a young buck full of curiousity my mind still wanted to explore.
      Exploration of the mind took place in classics written by Ralph Waldo
      Emmerson, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Norman Maclean.
